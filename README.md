# Urban Green Space Navigator

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Urban Green Space Navigator is an AI-powered mobile application designed to identify and recommend accessible green spaces within urban environments. By analyzing user preferences, real-time data, and community feedback, it aims to enhance urban dwellers' well-being by facilitating easy access to nature. Building AI course project.

## Background

Urbanization has led to a decrease in accessible green spaces, impacting mental and physical health. Many individuals struggle to find nearby parks, gardens, or natural areas that suit their needs (e.g., dog-friendly, child-friendly, quiet spaces). This project addresses the challenge of discovering and utilizing urban green spaces effectively.

  * Problem 1: Lack of awareness of nearby green spaces.
  * Problem 2: Difficulty in finding spaces that match specific user needs.
  * Problem 3: Inconsistent information about park amenities and conditions.

My personal motivation stems from observing the positive impact of nature on stress reduction and overall well-being. This project is important because it promotes healthier urban living and fosters a stronger connection to nature within communities.

## How is it used?

Users will input their preferences (e.g., distance, amenities, activities) and location into the mobile app. The AI will then provide a list of recommended green spaces, including photos, user reviews, and real-time data (e.g., crowd levels, weather). The app will also offer navigation and information on accessibility.
